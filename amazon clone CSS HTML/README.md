This is the clone of amazon I made as a part of leaning the front-end development of the technologies. 
This was the very first clone I ever made with the help of it from youtube.
This project is a frontend Amazon clone, created as my first step into front-end development. 
The goal of building this clone was to understand and implement core web development concepts.
It serves as a practice ground for exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Debugging and integrating multiple elements proved to be challenging but rewarding. 
This project lays the foundation for more advanced e-commerce solutions as I continue to learn and improve my skills.
