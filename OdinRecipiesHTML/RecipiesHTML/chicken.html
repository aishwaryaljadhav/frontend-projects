    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Season chicken pieces all over with the Morton’s seasoning blend.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.<br>Add chicken pieces, skin sides down, and cook until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.<br>Turn chicken pieces and brown again, 6 to 8 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add broth and water; bring to a boil over high heat.<br> Add onion, poultry seasoning, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper.<br>Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 20 minutes.<br>Add carrots and celery.<br>Leaving pot partially covered, continue simmering over low heat until vegetables are almost tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sift flour, baking powder, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl.<br>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together egg and buttermilk.</li>
        <li>Cut chilled butter into dry mixture using a pastry cutter or two forks.<br>Blend well to a crumbly consistency.<br>Add buttermilk mixture and gently stir with a wooden spoon until combined.<br>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn out dough onto a floured surface.<br>Using your hands, pat dough to approximately 1-inch thickness and gently fold outer edges into center.<br>Continue to gently fold—do not knead—until it comes together.<br>Pat dough out again to approximately 1-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Remove cooked chicken from Dutch oven (an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken should register 170 degrees F /76 degrees C) and put it on a plate.<br>Cover with foil to keep warm. Skim fat from broth.<br>Bring broth to a gentle boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Using a knife, cut dough into 9 (2x2-inch) squares.<br>Gently drop each square, one at a time, into boiling broth.<br>Lower heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until all dumplings rise to top and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.<br>Return chicken to pot and simmer an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon chicken and dumplin’s into bowls. Garnish with parsley.</li>
